Parallel Xen Migration Version 1.0.0
(Require Range-Lock Linux https://github.com/classicsong/Range-Lock-Linux)

The default working branch is parallel-xen-no-qos.
This branch should work with another Linux kernel project Range-Lock Linux ,https://github.com/classicsong/Range-Lock-Linux ,which greatly improve the scalability of our parallel migration tool. 


HOTO use:
The simple parallel migration commands is as follows:
xl migrate -m <dom_id> <config_file>
You should provide which domain to migration and a config_file.
A config_file template is as follows:
d_ip = 10.131.201.11:3333:3334,  10.131.201.12:3333:3334
h_ip = 10.131.201.21:3333:3334,  10.131.201.22:3333:3334
SSL_type = 1
ip_num = 2
slave_num = 4
max_iter = 30
max_factor = 3
max_downtime = 1000
is_qos = 0
nics = eth0, eth1

The FIRST TWO lines shows the destination ip:port pair in receving migration data (2 ips, four ports are used in the example) and the host ip:port pair in sending the data
The THIRD line shows whether use SSL connection for migration. The vanilla Xen use ssh connection to transfer data due to security concerns. We also provide SSL conncetions in migration.
The FORTH line shows how many ips are used.
The FIFTH line shows how many data sending slaves are used. (must match the number of ip:port pairs in the FIRST line)
The SIXTH line shows the maximum iterations the migration process will take. 
The SEVENTH line shows the maximum number of memory data to be sent in the migration (when it is reached, the migration process will force the migration)
The EIGHTH line shows the maximum_domtime the migration can endure, when the estimiated downtime is below max_downtime, the migration process will enter the last iteration (1000ms in the example)
The NINTH line shows whether use network qos support in the migration. The network qos support is added in branch new-para.
The TENTH line shows which nics are used. Our system will monitor the network bandwidth of the specified NICs
